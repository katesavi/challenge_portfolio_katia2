# Task 1: software configuration #
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge? ##

Hello, my name is **Katia**. 
I decided to participate in this project because it is a great opportunity to learn new things about testing and adapt old ones.
I love challenges, that's why I constantly seek out new knowledge. I possess the basics of software testing and got ISTQB Foundation Certificate. 
Unfortunatelly I did not get a new job yet. Getting new experience with automation tools/wrameworks can help me in finding a job as a manual/automation tester in the future. I am very grateful for such opportunity.
My goals in the near future are: to improve my knowledge of HTML, CSS, SQL and generally to learn new things because I love it ðŸ™ƒ
