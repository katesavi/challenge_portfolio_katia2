# Task 1: software configuration #
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge? ##

Hello, my name is **Katia**. 
I decided to participate in the project because learning new things about testing such as automation is a great opportunity to broaden my knowledge.
I love challenges, that's why I constantly seek out new knowledge. I possess the basics of software testing. I completed the course in Software Development Academy and got ISTQB Foundation Certificate. 
I also learned a lot about testing from  Utest Academy.
Getting new experience with automation tools/wrameworks can help me in finding a job as a manual/automation tester in the future. 
I have also goals in the near future:
 - to improve my knowledge of HTML, CSS and SQL 
 - to improve English, because I love it ðŸ™ƒ
